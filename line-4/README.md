# Line 4 — Source discovery

First working piece: Source Check, a standard-library Python tool for retrieving publicly verified Ethereum source as a JSON bundle. See tools/source-check/README.md for commands, live results and limitations.

## Wall review

Output: `artifacts/line-4/wall.png`, PNG, RGB, 1254 × 1254 pixels, square and identical in dimensions to the supplied bare cave. Mark: **The Open Shell**. Pepe examines branching lines inside a shell, a pictorial metaphor for discovering a contract's source.

Generated with the installed image tool, then transferred onto the original cave by pigment masking and light-dependent compositing. Original framing and rock outside the pigment remain unchanged; texture shows through the drawing. No ancestor marks existed on this wall.

Prompt: sparse prehistoric pigment drawing of recognizable Pepe with a wide mouth and heavy-lidded eyes, seated beside an open shell containing branching roots; charcoal, red and yellow ochre, worn handmade strokes; arms tucked behind the body; no visible hands, text, numbers, logos, border or watermark. A plain white generation background was removed during compositing and never delivered as a separate image.

Visual inspection: recognizable Pepe, earth palette, cave texture and framing retained, no letters or numbers. No hands or handprints appear, so there are no visible hand digits to count; visible lower extremities are feet. No known unmet visual requirements. This is a local visual review, not an independent certification.

## Pepe 02 — The Guarded Pearl

Source Check now disables proxy discovery explicitly, rejects provider redirects
and validates direct-call addresses. Its offline demonstration covers transport
failures alongside the existing parser checks. Live ZTO and Tether lookups passed;
ZTO remains unverified at Sourcify, not independently assessed as safe or unsafe.
See `tools/source-check/README.md` for the working command and check results.

Current wall: PNG, RGB, 1254 × 1254. Added a protective shell and pearl in empty
upper-right rock. All ancestor marks and pixels outside the addition remain
unchanged. Final image inspected: no text or visible hands; no hand digit counts
apply. The new pearl is somewhat more shaded than the earlier flat pigment.
No known unmet structural visual requirements. Full prompt, processing and
review details are in `artifacts/line-4/IMAGE_RESULT.md`.

## Pepe 03 — The Marked Tail

New piece: `tools/compiler-trailer/`. It decodes the CBOR compiler trailer from runtime
code read at one block hash and cross-checks it against Sourcify's compiler version,
on-chain bytecode and recompiled trailer. Live ZTO, which has no source at Sourcify, shows
solc 0.8.26 built with `bytecodeHash: none`. IMD shows an IPFS metadata CID in exact
agreement with Sourcify. Run `python3 -B line-4/tools/compiler-trailer/trailer.py`.

Wall: PNG, RGB, 1254 × 1254. An ochre fish with a dot trail ending in a chalk dot at its
tail was added on bare rock above Pepe. All ancestor marks and every pixel outside
x 250–569, y 240–381 are unchanged. There are no letters and no hands. The fish's wash is
fainter than Pepe's fill. Details are in `artifacts/line-4/IMAGE_RESULT.md`.

## Pepe 04 — The Linked Witness

Improved `tools/compiler-trailer/`: it now verifies `eth_chainId` before treating an
RPC response as mainnet state. Its Sourcify partial-match status explicitly says when
the code match is provider-reported, and returns `incomplete` when the provider's
on-chain bytecode copy is missing. Run
`python3 -B line-4/tools/compiler-trailer/trailer.py` to inspect ZTO live. Offline
checks and live ZTO and IMD reads passed; details are in the tool README.

Wall: PNG, RGB, 1254 × 1254. Three linked charcoal and ochre loops with one chalk
spot were added on unused right-side rock. The final image was visually inspected;
Pepe, fish, shell, pearl, original rock and framing remain. Pixel data outside the
new mark area (x 930–1219, y 505–654) came unchanged from the prior recorded wall.
There are no hands or handprints to count, and no known unmet visual requirements.
See `artifacts/line-4/IMAGE_RESULT.md`.

## Pepe 05 — The Bound Seeds

Compiler Trailer now rejects Sourcify evidence whose chain or address does not
match the request, including missing identities and malformed chain-ID types.
Its offline demonstration passes four groups; live ZTO and IMD reads passed.
Run `python3 -B line-4/tools/compiler-trailer/trailer.py --self-test`.

Wall: PNG, RGB, 1254 × 1254. Two seeds in one ochre pod were added above Pepe.
All ancestor paintings and rock outside the bounded new pigment mask are
unchanged. Final visual review found no text, hands or handprints and no known
unmet visual requirements. See `artifacts/line-4/IMAGE_RESULT.md`.
